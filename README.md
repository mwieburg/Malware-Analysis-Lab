# Malware-Analysis-Lab

This project was completed to establish a isolated environment for analyzing malware from various sources. The lab consists of 2 virtual machines running on isolated virtual interfaces using Proxmox. The segmentation of the malware analysis VMs is managed by a pfSense firewall to secure the communication between the labs and other machines when malware is detonated. 

## Flare-VM: Windows Malware Analysis VM
The Windows VM for malware analysis was created using Proxmox virtualization software. To setup the Flare-VM environment in my Proxmox Windows 10 VM, the main github page was followed to install the tools for malware analysis and reverse engineering (https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm)

## Remnux: Linux Malware Analysis VM

Remnux is a Linux tool for malware analysis and can be used for reverse engineering and studying malware designed to exploit Linux OS environments. To install the OVA Image as a new VM in my Proxmox server, I followed the steps provided on the Remnux.org setup page (https://docs.remnux.org/install-distro/get-virtual-appliance).
